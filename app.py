    "title": "AI-Powered Virtual Courtroom Simulation",
    "description": """AI-Virtual Courtroom Simulation  
Overview:  
Developed an advanced multi-agent AI system that simulates courtroom proceedings by integrating client inputs, legal research, logical analysis, professional legal advice, opposing arguments, and final judicial verdicts. The project demonstrates the application of AI in legal reasoning and decision-making.

Technologies Used:  
Python, Streamlit, Large Language Models (LLM), Generative AI, Multi-Agent Systems, NLP

Approach:  
- Designed specialized AI agents to represent different legal roles (Client, Law Researcher, Logic Analyzer, Legal Advisor, Opponent Lawyer, and Judge)  
- Integrated LLM-powered reasoning for law retrieval, case analysis, and advice generation  
- Enabled simulation of real courtroom dynamics with counter-arguments and verdict generation  
- Developed an interactive Streamlit interface for document uploads, case extraction, and step-by-step courtroom flow

Key Contributions:  
- Implemented the **Client Agent** to process and present case inputs in structured form  
- Built the **Law Research Agent** to fetch and simplify relevant laws, sections, and precedents  
- Developed the **Logic Analyzer Agent** to validate arguments and highlight strengths/weaknesses  
- Engineered the **Legal Advisor Agent** to provide actionable, client-friendly advice  
- Designed the **Opponent Lawyer Agent** to generate realistic counter-arguments  
- Created the **AI Judge Agent** to synthesize all perspectives and deliver a balanced verdict  
- Orchestrated the entire multi-agent pipeline in Streamlit for smooth end-to-end user experience

Outcome:  
Delivered an **AI-powered legal simulation platform** that mirrors courtroom reasoning by combining law research, logical evaluation, and judicial decision-making. This project demonstrates the potential of AI multi-agent systems in the legal domain, making complex legal analysis accessible and interactive.
